Spotted sends help to those in need during natural disaster by providing their accurate location to the appropriate Rescue Teams.

A camera with state of the art human detection technology is mounted upon a drone which flies over the affected area and relays back relevant rescue information to the rescue teams. For instance: exact location and number of the victims. Victims can also contact Google Assisstant for First Aid information.

Volunteers can sign up, view the status of the victims and can choose to help.
